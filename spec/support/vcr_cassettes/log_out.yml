        I have almost no emotional connection to that sentence. That\u2019s what happens
        when you grow up with something that\u2019s been normalized. If you\u2019ve
        grown up with parents who didn\u2019t speak english, or had a sibling with
        a disability, you know what I\u2019m talking about. To the world around you
        it may seem unique or odd, but for you it just is. To me, it\u2019s odd to
        think that my Uncle does not share the same genetics as the rest of us because
        he literally has the same height, facial features, emotional demeanour and
        sense of humor as the rest of the family. This is why my grandparents preached

        my grandparents were desperate enough for a boy that they adopted my uncle,

        any way he can. They are two generations deep in reaping the benefits of one
